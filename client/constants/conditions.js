    1.  each antibody produced using living animals 
    2.  the current state of knowledge in the relevant area of scientific research 
    3.  any validated non-animal alternatives already available 
    4.  any identically active antibodies or alternative binding or affinity reagents already available, either commercially or through other means 
    5.  why existing antibodies or reagents are unsuitable and why it’s necessary to produce an antibody using living animals 
    6.  the scientific rationale for producing each antibody using living animals, for example: 
        1. a statement that you’ve tried to use a non-animal alternative and this approach has failed, including the scientific reasons why  
        2. a statement that extrapolation of existing data strongly indicates that a non-animal antibody alternative is highly unlikely to be suitable 
        3. a statement that the target epitope does not bind to non-animal alternatives 
        4. discussion of availability and timeliness of non-animal antibody alternatives - this may be particularly relevant for therapeutic applications or where there is a scientific urgency (for example, global infectious disease pandemics where there is a need for a new diagnostic)
        
        Note: The regulator will not accept cost or convenience as reasons why you haven’t developed or used non-animal alternatives to produce antibodies (or used a third party)
